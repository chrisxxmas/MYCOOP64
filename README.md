YamlDotNet is a YAML library for [netstandard and other .NET runtimes](#the-yamldotnet-library).

YamlDotNet provides low level parsing and emitting of YAML as well as a high level object model similar to XmlDocument. A serialization library is also included that allows to read and write objects from and to YAML streams.

YamlDotNet's conformance with YAML specifications:
